#   Mobile Phone Price Prediction

##   Overview

    This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications. The goal is to classify phones into price ranges: low, medium, high, and very high.

##   Dataset

    The dataset, `mobile_phone_pricing.csv`, contains various features of mobile phones and their corresponding price ranges.
